# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the **Swaptor** contract was done by **Bugzy Von Buggernaut**.

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# Overview

The Swaptor contract enables atomic swaps between ERC20 and ERC721 assets. Sellers sign a desired swap, either with a defined or undefined buyer. A buyer can then use the Seller's signature along with the relevant swap data to execute the trade on Swaptor.

# Detailed Findings

## [H-01] Assuming non-reverting ERC20 transfers are successful puts user funds at risk

### Severity

**Impact:** High, because users won't receive funds from the counter-party. They can get scammed.

**Likelihood:** Medium, because a user would need to want to trade a token that returns false on failed transfers, like ZRX
### Code Location

105; 110; 167; 219
### Description

All ERC20 transfer functions are implemented as so:

```solidity
IERC20Upgradeable(wantedERC20).transferFrom(
	_msgSender(),
	seller,
	wantedERC20Amount
);
```

On the surface it looks okay, but the issue is that ERC20 as a standard has not been implemented consistently across tokens.

One such issue is that tokens like [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code) don't revert on transfer failure but instead return false.

This means that a malicious actor could conduct a swap with a token like ZRX, not pay the counter-party, yet still receive the tokens.

A malicious actor doesn't even need to hold any ZRX, they just need to create many attractive selling offers and wait for another user to get tricked.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

To avoid the above issue, it's recommended to use `safeTransferFrom` from OpenZeppelin's [SafeERC20 Lib](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) for ERC20 transfers.

As per the docs: "To use this library you can add a `using SafeERC20 for ERC20;` statement to your contract, which allows you to call the safe operations as `token.safeTransfer(…​)`, etc."

Here is the code snippet that prevents the described issue:

```solidity
 bytes memory returndata = address(token).functionCall(data, "SafeERC20: low-level call failed");
        if (returndata.length > 0) {
            // Return data is optional
            require(abi.decode(returndata, (bool)), "SafeERC20: ERC20 operation did not succeed");
        }
```

Note that since [OpenZeppelin v5](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), "The upgradeable library no longer includes upgradeable variants for libraries and interfaces.", meaning it's safe to use `SafeERC20` instead of `SafeERC20Upgradable` (The same applies for `ECDSAUpgradeable`).

## [M-01] Use `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom` for ERC721 transfers

### Severity

**Impact:** Medium, either the trade won't execute properly (possibly with the seller/buyer leaving with both the bid and the ask), or an NFT buyer permanently loses their purchase.

**Likelihood:** Medium, most users purchasing NFTs with smart contracts are assumed to be somewhat sophisticated, and an attacker wouldn't stand to gain considerable value from an intentional scam.
### Code Location

162; 224; 276; 281
### Description

The ERC721 `transferFrom()` method is used instead of `safeTransferFrom()`.

This is not recommended because:

i) Smart contracts are sometimes incapable of receiving ERC721 tokens and `onERC721Received()` is a safeguard against this.

ii) Some NFT's have logic in the `onERC721Received()` function, which is only triggered in the `safeTransferFrom()` function and not by `transferFrom()` (e.g. [here](https://github.com/sz-piotr/eth-card-game/blob/master/src/ethereum/contracts/ERC721Market.sol#L20-L31))

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Call the `safeTransferFrom()` method instead of `transferFrom()`. This is also recommended by [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-)

## [L-01] `OwnableUpgradeable` uses single-step ownership transfer

### Severity

**Impact:** Low, because it requires an error on the admin side

**Likelihood:** Medium, the contract will no longer be upgradable and the team won't be able to change certain parameters or take profits
### Code Location

16
### Description

Single-step ownership transfer means that if a wrong address is passed when transferring ownership or admin rights, the role is lost forever. The ownership pattern implementation for the protocol is in `OwnableUpgradeable.sol` where a single-step transfer is implemented. This can be a problem for all methods marked with `onlyOwner` throughout the protocol.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It is a best practice to use the two-step ownership transfer pattern, meaning ownership transfer gets to a "pending" state and the new owner can claim their new rights, otherwise the old owner still has control of the contract. 

Consider using OpenZeppelin's `Ownable2StepUpgradable` contract, but be aware that [`Ownable2StepUpgradeable` requires initialising `OwnableUpgradeable`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/4690) with `__Ownable_init(address initialOwner)`.

## [I-01] Upgrade ECDSAUpgradeable.sol

Since  [OpenZeppelin v5](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), "The upgradeable library no longer includes upgradeable variants for libraries and interfaces.", and therefore it's safe to use `ECDSA.sol` (v5) on upgradable contracts.

Although highly unlikely in Swaptor's case, there are known issues with the v4 ECDSA Library (>= 4.1.0 < 4.7.3) where the single byte argument version of `ECDSA.recover` is vulnerable to replay attacks.

## [I-02] Chainlink’s latestRoundData might return stale or incorrect results

If there is problem with Chainlink starting a new round and finding consensus (e.g. chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) , `latestRoundData` may use outdated or incorrect data .
 
This doesn't pose significant threat to Swaptor but can be circumvented by adding the following:
  
```solidity
( roundId, rawPrice, , updateTime, answeredInRound ) = AggregatorV3Interface(XXXXX).latestRoundData();
require(rawPrice > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0");
require(updateTime != 0, "Incomplete round");
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");
```

### Discussion

Bugzy: Fixed

## [I-03] A view function that returns the `msg.value` required to cover the `fee` would help to avoid confusion regarding dollar vs wei denomination.

Currently a `fee` parameter exists in the contract and it's easy to assume that whatever this is is the `fee` a user must pay.  However, when the price oracle is set, this is not the case.

For example, assuming the fee is $5 (5*(10^8))) and the price oracle is set, when a user sends 500,000,000 wei, the function will revert. 

This will cause UX friction as a user will need to work out the fee manually (i.e. query the oracle, and do the math). A `getFee` function would help circumvent this.
